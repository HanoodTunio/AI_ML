what is Classification in Machine learning, its types?

Classification in machine learning involves predicting the category or class label of an instance based on past data with known labels. 
There are several types:

1. Binary Classification: Predicting between two classes (e.g., spam or not spam).
2. Multi-class Classification: Predicting among multiple classes (e.g., types of fruits).
3. Multi-label Classification: Assigning multiple labels to instances (e.g., tagging images).
4. Imbalanced Classification: Handling datasets with unequal class distributions.
5. Ordinal Classification: Predicting ordered categories (e.g., movie ratings).

Each type has its own characteristics and requires different approaches and algorithms.
